## Assignment 1 - A simple reactive internet application
This is a simple client and server, that accesses a weather forecast for the next 5 days based on a user inputted city, using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
It then displays some simple weather data on the browser. 
For submission purposes, it is completely unstyled. 

Documentation on the API can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).
